      <h1>Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by <b> SHAPEAI</b>.</h1>
      <p>The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (Data Analyst Intern at Jio). I got to
learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.

<p><b>I got to have hands on experience on:
</b></p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>JAVASCRIPT</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>REACTJS</li>
</ul> 
</p>
<p>During these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well. To register for next free 7 days bootcamp, visit:
